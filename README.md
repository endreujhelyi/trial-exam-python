### Explain the algorithm used in exercise 2. Use a flowchart, structogram or pseudo code. [2p]
#### Your answer:

Ok, so I write pseudocode explain my solution.


LETTER_COUNTER method gets an input FILE_NAME:

created a LETTER variable with a string value 'a', what letter is looked for

SUM_LETTER variable counts the occurences of LETTER in FILE_NAME

IF the path of FILE_NAME not valid:
  - RETURN 0 value

ELSE the path is valid:
  - stored the opened file in the TEXT variable
  - FOR each LINE of the TEXT:
    - FOR every CHARACTER in the LINE:
      - IF CHARACTER is equal LETTER ('a'):
        - increase SUM_LETTER with 1
  - close the opened FILE_NAME
RETURN the value of SUM_LETTER
